BinarySearchTree File

BinarySearchTree.h, BinarySearchTree.cpp, main.cpp, Makefile, and the README.txt are all of the documents for the search file.

This program displays a menu for the user where he or she can select what operation that they want to do on the binaryTree structure.  The options on the menu are adding a node tot he tree, removing a node from the tree, getting a node from the tree, getting the length of nodes on the tree, determining if the binary tree is full or is empty, clears the nodes on the binary tree structure so that the user can start all over at any time, and it prints the binary tree structure to the user by either inorder, preorder, or postorder displaying the elements of the linked binary tree structure. 

I utilized the Sublime text editor and the Ubunta Commandline in order to compile this program by methods of creating a Makefile.  In order to compile this program correctly, then all of the files have to be copied into their own directory which I called mine "lab6".  After this is done, then you have to make the "tree" file by typing <make> into the commandline.  Then by looking at the "lab6" directory, you should have a "tree" file which usually appears as a bright yellow directory.  In order to run this you must type  </.tree> and then <enter> into the commandline.  In order to clean the file or to re-make the file, then you must type <make clean> in the same lab6 directory. This should clean the file for a new rebuild.  

Enclosed in "double-quotation marks" indicates a file or directory name.
Enclosed in <arrow operators tag structure> indicates buttons needed to be pressed by programmer or end-user.

Test Data utilized for addNode function was: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
Test Data utilized for removeNode function was: 2, 4.
Test Data utilized for getNode function was: 3.
Test Data utilized for inorderTraversal function was: 1, 3, 5.
Test Data utilized for PreorderTraversal function was: 1, 3, 5.
Test Data utilized for PostorderTraversal function was: 5, 3, 1.

Even though these are the data that I utilized for my compilation, any valid data range should and could be utilized.
